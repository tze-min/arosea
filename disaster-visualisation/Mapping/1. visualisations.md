visualisations
(currently work in progress). Data is uploaded in github. Coordinates are mostly correct (except for a few errant ones here and there. Errors will be rectified when spotted and data updated whenever there are changes.
colours/presentation can be changed, do let me know if there is a certain point that you want to make. below are just some simple samples.

visualisatiosn here were made with QGIS and briefly edited with Canva

## 1. all disasters
the GIF below shows the disaster hotspots. It is meant to be a broad glance sort of thing.

the GIF below shows the disaster hotspots weighted by total affected.Compared to the general disaster hotspots, lesser stuff are highlighted because the disasters with higher number of total affected becomes more obvious

## 2. earthquakes
there's something wrong with this visualisation that is bothering me. it shows the top earthquakes by total people affected and also all earthquakes by richter scale.

for consideration:
1. the scale is weird but any other scale would make it hard to read
2. if its whether some region experiences more earthquakes at higher magnitudes than i would just forgo the total affected?? or make it pop up in animation instead
3. So say I want one just to compare regions that are affected by different Richter scales I would separate all the Richter 4,5,6,7,8 events n maybe put in gif

alternative earthquake images/presentations
before i settled with what you see above i also tried some other visualisations

## 3.. floods and storms (aka water related stuff)
i visualised these together. this is not a flood and storm event visualisation but one where total affected is accounter for (weighted by total affected)
I can do one which is only event (not weighted by number of people affected). I suspect the indonesia/philippines area will pop up more in that case

on hindsight i should have added the legend for the gifs 

also if anyone is more familiar with premier pro / adobe animate can add stuff like that to add the "top" affecting floods. i have the programmes but limtied experience so will be v slow cos have to figure out still
