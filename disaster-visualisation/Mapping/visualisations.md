Working visualisations
(currently work in progress). Data is uploaded in github. Coordinates are mostly correct (except for a few errant ones here and there. Errors will be rectified when spotted and data updated whenever there are changes.
colours/presentation can be changed, do let me know if there is a certain point that you want to make. below are just some simple samples.

## 1. all disasters
the GIF below shows the disaster hotspots. It is meant to be a broad glance sort of thing.

the GIF below shows the disaster hotspots weighted by total affected.


## 2. earthquakes
there's something wrong with this visualisation that is bothering me. it shows the top earthquakes by total people affected and also all earthquakes by richter scale.

for consideration:
1. the scale is weird but any other scale would make it hard to read
2. if its whether some region experiences more earthquakes at higher magnitudes than i would just forgo the total affected?? or make it pop up in animation instead
3. So say I want one just to compare regions that are affected by different Richter scales I would separate all the Richter 4,5,6,7,8 events n maybe put in gif

alternative earthquake images/presentations
before i settled with what you see above i also tried some other visualisations

## 3.. floods and storms (aka water related stuff)
i visualised these together. this is not a flood and storm event visualisation but one where total affected is accounter for (weighted by total affected)
I can do one which is only event (not weighted by number of people affected). I suspect the indonesia/philippines area will pop up more in that case


also if anyone is more familiar with premier pro / adobe animate can add stuff like that to add the "top" affecting floods. i have the programmes but limtied experience so will be v slow cos have to figure out still
