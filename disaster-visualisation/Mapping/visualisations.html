<h1>Working visualisations</h1>

<p>currently work in progress. Data is uploaded in github. Coordinates are mostly correct (except for a few errant ones here and there. Errors will be rectified when spotted and data updated whenever there are changes. 
<br>
colours/presentation can be changed, do let me know if there is a certain point that you want to make. below are just some simple samples.
</p>
    

<h2>1. all disasters </h2>
    <p> the GIF below shows the disaster hotspots. It is meant to be a broad glance sort of thing.  </p>
    
    <img src="C:\Users\wenting\Documents\AROSEA\AROSEA Mapping\Visualisations\1. All disasters no duplicates\red w land\magma COUNT\GIF-COUNT.gif" width="985" height="697" > 
    
    <p> the GIF below shows the disaster hotspots weighted by total affected. </p>
     <img src="C:\Users\wenting\Documents\AROSEA\AROSEA Mapping\Visualisations\1. All disasters no duplicates\red w land\redblack total affected\red-totalaffectedGIF.gif">
         
<h2>2. earthquakes</h2>
    <p> there's something wrong with this visualisation that is bothering me. it shows the top earthquakes by total people affected and also all earthquakes by richter scale. </p>
        <img src="C:\Users\wenting\Documents\AROSEA\AROSEA Mapping\Visualisations\3. Earthquake\to increase quality w adobe10241024_1.jpg" alt="all disasters">
    <p> for consideration: 
        <br>
        1. the scale is weird but any other scale would make it hard to read 
        <br>
        2. if its whether some region experiences more earthquakes at higher magnitudes than i would just forgo the total affected?? or make it pop up in animation instead
        <br>
        3. So say I want one just to compare regions that are affected by different Richter scales I would separate all the Richter 4,5,6,7,8 events n maybe put in gif </p>
    
    <h3> alternative earthquake images/presentations</h3>
    <p> before i settled with what you see above i also tried some other visualisations </p>
<div class="clearfix">
  <div class="img-container">
  <img src="C:\Users\wenting\Documents\AROSEA\AROSEA Mapping\Visualisations\3. Earthquake\earthquake V1.jpg" alt="eq-v1" style="width:100%">
  </div>
  <div class="img-container">
  <img src="C:\Users\wenting\Documents\AROSEA\AROSEA Mapping\Visualisations\3. Earthquake\earthquake v4.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
  </div>

</div>


    
<h2>3.. floods and storms (aka water related stuff) </h2>
    <p> i visualised these together. this is not a flood and storm event visualisation but one where total affected is accounter for (weighted by total affected)
    <br> 
    I can do one which is only event (not weighted by number of people affected). I suspect the indonesia/philippines area will pop up more in that case </p>
    
    <img src="C:\Users\wenting\Documents\AROSEA\AROSEA Mapping\Visualisations\2. Floods and Storms\Floods and storms-weighted total affected\floods and storms total affected weighted.gif" width="985" height="697" > 
         
    
    <p> also if anyone is more familiar with premier pro / adobe animate can add stuff like that to add the "top" affecting floods. i have the programmes but limtied experience so will be v slow cos have to figure out still </p>
